# gh auth login -> Github.com -> HTTPS -> Yes -> Login with web -> enter in one-time code

1. Stage your changes:
   git add .

2. Commit your changes (replace "Your message" with a description):
   git commit -m "Your message"

3. Push to the main branch:
   git push origin main

# Notes:
- Run these from the project root in your WSL terminal.
- If the branch is not 'main', replace with your branch name (e.g., 'master').
- If pushing for the first time, you may need to set upstream: git push -u origin main.
- Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication if prompted.
